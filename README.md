This project is a simple Python Flask web application that displays “Hello from Docker Compose!” when you access it in your browser. It uses a Dockerfile to build a lightweight Python environment with Flask installed (as listed in requirements.txt), and docker-compose.yml to easily build and run the app in a container with port 5000 exposed. To run it, make sure Docker is installed, open a terminal in the project folder, and use docker-compose up --build — then visit http://localhost:5000. To stop it, press Ctrl + C and run docker-compose down. This setup makes it easy to develop, test, and deploy the Flask app in a consistent container environment.
